Hello!

I'm Mike.  Just getting back into the programming world after spending 15 years as an executive for a construction company.  I've written code in C/C++, Java, Python/Django, SQL, COBOL, Basic & Assmebly.

I resigned from my position in March and will be studying new web technologies to familiarize myself with current programming practices.

I'm a competitive age group marathoner and also participate in triathlons and other road races from time to time.
